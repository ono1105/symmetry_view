"""Judging for the "name this point group" puzzle (docs/PUZZLE_SPEC.md).

The structure itself is shown, bare -- no highlighted axis or animation, the same
way the structure picker renders it -- and the player names its overall point
group from a small multiple-choice list. Unlike the other four quizzes, which
each ask about one axis, operation, product or atom, this is a single
capstone question per structure: the whole structure's own symmetry class,
already known from ``render_data["metadata"]["point_group_label"]``. No new
geometry is computed here.

Renderer-independent: consumes ``render_data`` only.

Molecules and crystals use different label vocabularies -- Schoenflies (``Oh``,
``D3h``) for molecules, Hermann-Mauguin/ITC (``m-3m``, ``-6m2``) for crystals --
so a crystal question must not offer a Schoenflies distractor and vice versa.
Both vocabularies are described by the same small table of standard
group-theory facts (order, highest proper rotation, and a notational "shape"
family such as "has a horizontal mirror" vs "has diagonal mirrors"), and
distractors are the closest entries by those facts. This is deliberately not a
hand-curated table of confusable pairs (docs/CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md warns against
hand-written exclusion/pairing lists): classic confusions like D3h vs D3d or
C2v vs C2h fall out on their own because those pairs differ in exactly one of
these properties.
